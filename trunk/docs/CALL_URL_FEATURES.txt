Call URL features(start call url, dispo call url, etc...)



Details on the Call URL and webform-type fields and dynamic URL construction:



Web Form -  This is where you can set the custom web page that will be
opened when the user clicks on the WEB FORM button. To customize the
query string after the web form, simply begin the web form with VAR
and then the URL that you want to use, replacing the variables with
the variable names that you want to use --A--phone_number--B-- just
like in the SCRIPTS tab section. If you want to use custom fields in a web form 
address, you need to add &CF_uses_custom_fields=Y as part of your URL.

Start Call URL -  This web URL address is not seen by the agent, but
it is called every time a call is sent to an agent if it is populated.
Uses the same variables as the web form fields and scripts. This URL
can NOT be a relative path. The Start URL does not work for Manual
dial calls. Default is blank.

Dispo Call URL - This web URL address is not seen by the agent, but it
is called every time a call is dispositioned by an agent if it is
populated. Uses the same variables as the web form fields and scripts.
dispo, talk_time, call_notes and callback_lead_status are the extra variables 
you can use with this specific function. 'dispo' is the actual agent-defined 
status disposition for the call, and callback_lead_status is the agent-selected
status when a scheduled callback status has been selected by the agent. The 
actual talk time in seconds of the call is talk_time. This URL can NOT be a 
relative path. It is always called from the webserver. Default is blank.

Add Lead URL -  This web URL address is not seen by the agent, but it is called
every time a lead is added to the system through the inbound process. Default 
is blank. You must begin this URL with VAR if you want to use variables, and of
course --A-- and --B-- around the actual variable in the URL where you want to
use it. Here is the list of variables that are available for this function: 
lead_id, vendor_lead_code, list_id, phone_number, phone_code, did_id, 
did_extension, did_pattern, did_description, uniqueid, call_id. This feature is
only available for In-Groups.

No Agent Call URL - This is similar to Dispo Call URL, but it is for calls
that are not sent to agents such as DROPs, No Answers, Busys and timeouts. This 
option is available for Campaigns and In-Groups. This feature will only work for
auto-dial and inbound calls, not manual dial calls. For inbound calls, the 
specific in-group that a call was sent to needs to have the No Agent Call URL 
field filled in or this function will not run for that call.

CRM Popup Login - If set to Y, the CRM Popup Address is used to open a new 
window on agent login to this campaign. Default is N.

CRM Popup Address - The web address of a CRM login page, it can have variables 
populated just like the web form address, with the VAR in the front and using 
--A--user_custom_one--B-- to define variables. 




You can have lead information be auto-populated in the URL
options(webform, webform2, start_call_url, dispo_call_url, crm_popup_url) using

province, postal_code, country_code, gender, date_of_birth, alt_phone,
email, security_phrase, comments, lead_id, campaign, phone_login,
group, channel_group, SQLdate, epoch, uniqueid, customer_zap_channel,
server_ip, SIPexten, session_id, dialed_number, dialed_label, rank,
owner, camp_script, in_script, script_width, script_height,
recording_filename, recording_id, user_custom_one, user_custom_two,
user_custom_three, user_custom_four, user_custom_five,
preset_number_a, preset_number_b, preset_number_c, preset_number_d,
preset_number_e, preset_number_f, preset_dtmf_a, preset_dtmf_b,
